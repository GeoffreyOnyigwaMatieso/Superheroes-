# Superheroes-
Learning Goals

    Build a simple API using Rails.

# Introduction

For this assessment, you'll be working on an API for tracking heroes and their superpowers.

The instructions below will walk you through the process of ideation and planning your app: deciding on your models and relationships, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. You should work through all the planning steps before you start doing any coding.
Requirements

For this project, you must:

    Create a Rails API backend.
    Have at least three resources (three DB tables).

Project Setup

Once you have the plan in place for the application you want to build take the following steps:

    Create a new Rails project.
    Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
    Add your TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes. We promise, we won't steal your code)
    Ensure you regularly commit to the repository.

Project Guidelines

Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:
Models

You need to create the following relationships:

- A `Hero` has many `Power`s through `HeroPower`
- A `Power` has many `Hero`s through `HeroPower`
- A `HeroPower` belongs to a `Hero` and belongs to a `Power`

Start by creating the models and migrations for the following database tables:



Add any code needed in the model files to establish the relationships.

Then, run the migrations

You are welcome to generate your own seed data to test the application.
Validations

Add validations to the `HeroPower` model:

- `strength` must be one of the following values: 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Average'

Add validations to the `Power` model:

- `description` must be present and at least 20 characters long
Routes

specified along with the appropriate HTTP verb.

 PATCH /powers/:id

This route should update an existing `Power`. It should accept an object with

If the `Power` exists and is updated successfully (passes validations), update

the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{

}
```

If the `Power` is **not** updated successfully (does not pass validations),
return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```

 POST /hero_powers

This route should create a new `HeroPower` that is associated with an
existing `Power` and `Hero`. It should accept an object with the following
properties in the body of the request:

```
{
  "strength": "Average",
  "power_id": 1,
  "hero_id": 3
}
```

If the `HeroPower` is created successfully, send back a response with the data
related to the `Hero`:

```
{

    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "flight",
      "description": "gives the wielder the ability to fly through the skies at supersonic speed"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `HeroPower` is **not** created successfully, return the following
JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
